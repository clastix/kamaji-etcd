# Kamaji etcd
A set of tools to deploy and operate a multi-tenant `etcd` datastore for [Kamaji](https://github.com/clastix/kamaji) control-plane.

## Background
Kamaji turns any Kubernetes cluster into an “admin cluster” to orchestrate other Kubernetes clusters called “tenant clusters”. The Control Plane of a “tenant cluster” is made of regular pods running in a namespace of the “admin cluster” instead of a dedicated set of Virtual Machines. This solution makes running control planes at scale cheaper and easier to deploy and operate.

As of any Kubernetes cluster, a “tenant cluster” needs a datastore where to save the state and be able to retrieve data. Kamaji provides multiple options: a multi-tenant `etcd` as well as _MySQL_, and _PostgreSQL_, thanks to the [kine](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine) integration.

A multi-tenant deployment for `etcd` is not common practice. However, `etcd` provides simple and robust APIs for creating users and setting up role based access control (RBAC) policies to define which user have access to what key prefix.

## Documentation
Refer to the [etcd documentation](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide). Following sections provide additional procedures to help with a specific setup as it is used into project [Kamaji](https://github.com/clastix/kamaji).

- [Recovery from a snapshot](docs/snapshot-recovery.md)
- [Backup and Restore with Velero](docs/backup-and-restore.md)
- [Rotate Certificates](docs/rotate-certificates.md)
- [Performance and Optimization](docs/performance-and-optimization.md)

## Roadmap

- [x] Install High Available `etcd` cluster as StatefulSet
- [x] Provide data persistence through Persistent Volumes
- [x] Multi-tenancy
- [x] Autocompaction
- [x] Scheduled defragmentation
- [x] Auto generate certificates
- [x] Scheduled snapshots
- [x] Metrics Service Monitors
- [x] Alert rules
- [ ] Grafana dashboard
- [ ] Benchmarking

## Getting started
On the Kamaji's “admin cluster”, install the multi-tenant `etcd` with the provided Helm Chart:

```
helm repo add clastix https://clastix.github.io/charts
helm install kamaji-etcd clastix/kamaji-etcd -n kamaji-etcd --create-namespace
```

The certificates of `etcd`, are stored as secrets into the same namespace:

- `<release_name>-certs` contains CA, peers, and server certificates
- `<release_name>-root-client-certs` contains the user `root` certificates

Make sure the Kamaji controller can access these secrets in their namespaces.
